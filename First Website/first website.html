<h1> Olivia Wu</h1>


<p> Hi! I am Olivia. I was born in March 11, 2005, Monteal. My parents 
searched up ten names and asked a nurse to chose my name. She thought that 
I look like Olivia, so she named me Olivia! </p>

<p>I moved a lot!  I went to six schools in five cities starting from 
elementary school.Therefore, I met a lot of different people with different 
cultures. I also learnt many languages throughout my journey. </p>
